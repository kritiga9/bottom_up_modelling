# Bottom-Up Modeling for Metrics

## Introduction

In the world of business planning and budgeting, the traditional top-down approach often falls short in providing a clear and actionable roadmap for success. This README outlines the concept of Bottom-Up Modeling for Metrics, a methodology that offers a more effective and insightful way to understand and manage your business's performance. 

## The Problem with Top-Down Excel Budgeting

Before delving into the benefits of Bottom-Up Modeling, it's crucial to acknowledge the shortcomings of the conventional top-down Excel-based budgeting approach:

### Laborious
- Excel-based budgeting lacks code reusability, making it a time-consuming and repetitive process.

### Prone to Factual Errors
- Building budgets top-down can lead to factual errors as it often involves arbitrary adjustments without considering underlying causal metrics.

### Prone to Mechanical Errors
- Excel's limited version control and collaboration capabilities make it susceptible to mechanical errors when multiple stakeholders are involved.

### Useless
- Top-down budgeting typically focuses on high-level metrics, neglecting the crucial causal metrics that drive performance, rendering it less useful for informed decision-making.

### Harmful
- Disconnecting budgeting from the "how" can lead to unrealistic ambitions and harmful shortcuts that undermine long-term business success.

## The Bottom-Up Model of Metrics Solution

Bottom-Up Modeling for Metrics offers a refreshing alternative, providing the following advantages:

### 1. Run What-If Scenarios
- Understand the impact of changes in causal metrics on your top-priority metric by running what-if scenarios.

### 2. Estimate Initiative Value
- Evaluate the potential impact of initiatives by analyzing their effect on causal metrics and the bottom line.

### 3. Focus on the Right Levers
- Move away from oversimplified assumptions like "price increase lowers volume" and focus on the precise causal metrics that matter, such as traffic and conversion rates.

### 4. Solve Benchmarking Challenges
- Avoid the confusion of comparing actual performance with forecasts by having detailed metrics that facilitate accurate diagnosis.

### 5. Standardized Prioritization
- Compare the impact of initiatives across departments and prioritize resources efficiently based on a standardized prioritization metric.

## Feasibility and Implementation

Implementing Bottom-Up Modeling for Metrics may seem daunting, but it is entirely feasible and offers substantial long-term benefits:

### - Model is Reusable
- Invest time in developing the model once, and reap the rewards of minimal effort in subsequent iterations.

### - No Crystal Ball Needed
- The model's purpose isn't to predict the future but to provide a tool for assessing the impact of metric changes.

### - Last Year as Guidance
- Validate the model's accuracy by plugging in data from the previous year to obtain the priority metric for that period.

### - Modularity
- Delegate the details to other teams and go as deep as necessary, ensuring a manageable workload.

### - Simplification
- Start with simplified models and gradually add more detail as your understanding and capabilities grow.

By adopting Bottom-Up Modeling for Metrics, you can transform your planning and budgeting process into a dynamic, data-driven, and insightful tool that empowers your organization to make informed decisions and achieve sustainable growth.
